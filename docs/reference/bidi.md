The Espresso driver has partial support of the [WebDriver BiDi Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/).
It inherits [the BiDi commands and events supported by the Appium base driver](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/reference/api/bidi/),
and additionally defines the events and commands listed below.
