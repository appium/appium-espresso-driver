title: Execute Methods
---

The Espresso driver provides various [custom execute methods](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/execute-methods/)
based on the standard Execute Script endpoint. Use the following examples in order to invoke them
from your client code:

=== "Java"

    ```java
    var result = driver.executeScript("mobile: <methodName>", Map.ofEntries(
        Map.entry("arg1", "value1"),
        Map.entry("arg2", "value2")
        // you may add more pairs if needed or skip providing the map completely
        // if all arguments are defined as optional
    ));
    ```

=== "JS (WebdriverIO)"

    ```js
    const result = await driver.executeScript('mobile: <methodName>', [{
        arg1: "value1",
        arg2: "value2",
    }]);
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    result = driver.execute_script('mobile: <methodName>', {
        'arg1': 'value1',
        'arg2': 'value2',
    })
    ```

=== "Ruby"

    ```ruby
    result = @driver.execute_script 'mobile: <methodName>', {
        arg1: 'value1',
        arg2: 'value2',
    }
    ```

=== "C#"

    ```csharp
    object result = driver.ExecuteScript("mobile: <methodName>", new Dictionary<string, object>() {
        {"arg1", "value1"},
        {"arg2", "value2"}
    }));
    ```
