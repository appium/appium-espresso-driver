Appium's Espresso Driver is a test automation server for Android that uses [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/) as the underlying test technology. The Espresso Driver is a part of the Appium framework. The driver operates in scope of [W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) with several custom extensions to cover operating-system specific scenarios.

The Espresso package consists of two main parts:
- The driver part (written in Node.js) ensures the communication between the Espresso server and Appium. Also includes several handlers that directly use ADB and/or other system tools without a need to talk to the server.
- The server part (written in Kotlin with some parts of Java), which is running on the device under test and transforms REST API calls into low-level Espresso commands.

> **Note**
>
> Since version 2.0.0 Espresso driver has dropped the support of Appium 1, and is only compatible to Appium 2. Use the `appium driver install espresso`
> command to add it to your Appium 2 dist.

## Comparison with UiAutomator2

The key difference between [UiAutomator2 Driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver) and Espresso Driver is that UiAutomator2 is a black-box testing framework, and Espresso is a "grey-box" testing framework. The Espresso Driver itself is black-box (no internals of the code are exposed to the tester), but the Espresso framework itself has access to the internals of Android applications. This distinction has a few notable benefits. It can find elements that aren't rendered on the screen, it can identify elements by the Android View Tag, and it makes use of [IdlingResource](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/espresso/IdlingResource) which blocks the framework from running commands until the UI thread is free. There is a limited support of out-of-app areas automation via the [mobile: uiautomator](#mobile-uiautomator) command.

## Requirements

On top of standard Appium requirements Espresso driver also expects the following prerequisites:

- Windows, Linux and macOS are supported as hosts
- [Android SDK Platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) must be installed. [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio) also provides a convenient UI to install and manage the tools.
- ANDROID_HOME or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT [environment variable](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables) must be set
- Java JDK must be installed and [JAVA_HOME](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux) environment variable must be set. Java major version must be 11 or newer.
- [Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) platform image must be installed if you plan to run your tests on it. [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio) also provides a convenient UI to install and manage emulators.
- Real Android devices must have [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) and should be visible as `online` in `adb devices -l` output.
- The minimum version of Android API must be 5.0 (API level 21) (6.0 is recommended as version 5 has some known compatibility issues).
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) must be installed in order to build Espresso server.
- Both the server package and the application under test must be signed with the same digital signature. Appium does sign them automatically upon session creation, so this could only be an issue if one wants to test an application, which is already installed on the device (using `noReset=true` capability).
- The package under test must not have mangled class names (e.g. [Proguard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code) must not be enabled for it)


## Scripts

- `appium driver run espresso print-espresso-path` prints the path to the Appium Espresso server root. You can modify the gradle file directly if [Espresso Build Config](#espresso-build-config) was not sufficient.
- `appium driver run espresso build-espresso` builds the espresso server since driver version 2.18.0. It helps building the espresso server outside of the Appium process. Available environment variables are below:
  - `SHOW_GRADLE_LOG` configures if the command shows the gradle task logs. `true` or `1`  sets it as enabled, but others set it as disabled. Defaults to disabled.
  - `TEST_APP_PACKAGE` configures the target application to build the espresso server for.
  - `ESPRESSO_BUILD_CONFIG` is an absolute path to the [Espresso Build Config](#espresso-build-config) as JSON format file.
    - e.g. `SHOW_GRADLE_LOG=true TEST_APP_PACKAGE=your.test.pkg ESPRESSO_BUILD_CONFIG=/path/to/the/config.json appium driver run build-espresso`

## Capabilities

### General

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
platformName | Could be set to `android`. Appium itself is not strict about this capability value if `automationName` is provided, so feel free to assign it to any supported platform name if this is needed, for example, to make Selenium Grid working.
appium:automationName | Must always be set to `espresso`. Values of `automationName` are compared case-insensitively.
appium:deviceName | The name of the device under test (actually, it is not used to select a device under test). Consider setting `udid` for real devices and `avd` for emulators instead
appium:platformVersion | The platform version of an emulator or a real device. This capability is used for device autodetection if `udid` is not provided
appium:udid | UDID of the device to be tested. Could ve retrieved from `adb devices -l` output. If unset then the driver will try to use the first connected device. Always set this capability if you run parallel tests.
appium:noReset | Prevents the device to be reset before the session startup if set to `true`. This means that the application under test is not going to be terminated neither its data cleaned. `false` by default
appium:fullReset | Being set to `true` always enforces the application under test to be fully uninstalled before starting a new session. `false` by default
appium:printPageSourceOnFindFailure | Enforces the server to dump the actual XML page source into the log if any error happens. `false` by default.

### Driver/Server

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:systemPort | The number of the port the Espresso server is listening on. By default the first free port from 8300..8399 range is selected. It is recommended to set this value if you are running [parallel tests](docs/parallel-tests.md) on the same machine.
appium:skipServerInstallation | Skip the Espresso Server component installation on the device under test and all the related checks if set to `true`. This could help to speed up the session startup if you know for sure the correct server version is installed on the device. In case the server is not installed or an incorrect version of it is installed then you may get an unexpected error later. `false` by default
appium:espressoServerLaunchTimeout | The maximum number of milliseconds to wait util Espresso server is listening on the device. `45000` ms by default
appium:forceEspressoRebuild | Whether to always enforce Espresso server rebuild (`true`). By default Espresso caches the already built server apk and only rebuilds it when it is necessary, because rebuilding process needs extra time. `false` by default
appium:espressoBuildConfig | Either the full path to build config JSON on the server file system or the JSON content itself serialized to a string. This config allows to customize several important properties of Espresso server. Refer to [Espresso Build Config](#espresso-build-config) for more information on how to properly construct such config.
appium:showGradleLog | Whether to include Gradle log to the regular server logs while building Espresso server. `false` by default.

### App

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:app | Full path to the application to be tested (the app must be located on the same machine where the server is running). The `.apk` application extension is supported. Since driver version 2.1.0 `.aab` files are supported as well (they get converted to `.apk` format automatically if [bundletool.jar](https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases) could be found in your PATH). For older driver versions `.aab` files need to be [converted](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53040047/generate-apk-file-from-aab-file-android-app-bundle) manually to `.apk` format using [bundletool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/bundletool) first. Could also be an URL to a remote location. If neither of the `app` or `appPackage` capabilities are provided then the driver will fail to start a session. Also, if `app` capability is not provided it is expected that the app under test is already installed on the device under test and `noReset` is equal to `true`.
appium:appPackage | Application package identifier to be started. If not provided then Espresso will try to detect it automatically from the package provided by the `app` capability. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appActivity | Main application activity identifier. If not provided then Espresso will try to detect it automatically from the package provided by the `app` capability. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitActivity | Identifier of the first activity that the application invokes. If not provided then equals to `appium:appActivity`. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitPackage | Identifier of the first package that is invoked first. If not provided then equals to `appium:appPackage`. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:appWaitDuration | Maximum amount of milliseconds to wait until the application under test is started (e. g. an activity returns the control to the caller). `20000` ms by default. Read [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) for more details
appium:intentOptions | The mapping of custom options for the intent that is going to be passed to the main app activity. Check [Intent Options](#intent-options) for more details.
appium:activityOptions | The mapping of custom options for the main app activity that is going to be started. Check [Activity Options](#activity-options) for more details.
appium:androidInstallTimeout | Maximum amount of milliseconds to wait until the application under test is installed. `90000` ms by default
appium:autoGrantPermissions | Whether to grant all the requested application permissions automatically when a test starts(`true`). The targetSdkVersion in the application manifest must be greater or equal to 23 and the Android version on the device under test must be greater or equal to Android 6 (API level 23) to grant permissions. Applications whose targetSdkVersion is lower than or equal to 22 must be reisntalled to grant permissions, for example, by setting the `appium:fullReset` capability as `true` for Android 6+ devices. `false` by default
appium:otherApps | Allows to set one or more comma-separated paths to Android packages that are going to be installed along with the main application under test. This might be useful if the tested app has dependencies
appium:uninstallOtherPackages | Allows to set one or more comma-separated package identifiers to be uninstalled from the device before a test starts
appium:allowTestPackages | If set to `true` then it would be possible to use packages built with the test flag for the automated testing (literally adds `-t` flag to the `adb install` command). `false` by default
appium:remoteAppsCacheLimit | Sets the maximum amount of application packages to be cached on the device under test. This is needed for devices that don't support streamed installs (Android 7 and below), because ADB must push app packages to the device first in order to install them, which takes some time. Setting this capability to zero disables apps caching. `10` by default.
appium:enforceAppInstall | If set to `true` then the application under test is always reinstalled even if a newer version of it already exists on the device under test. `false` by default

### App Localization

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:localeScript | Canonical name of the locale to be set for the app under test, for example `Hans` in `zh-Hans-CN`. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details.
appium:language | Name of the language to extract application strings for. Strings are extracted for the current system language by default. Also sets the language for the app under test. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details. Example: en, ja
appium:locale | Sets the locale for the app under test. See https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html for more details. Example: EN, JA
appium:appLocale | Sets the locale for the app under test. The main difference between this option and the above ones is that this option only changes the locale for the application under test and does not affect other parts of the system. Also, it only uses public APIs for its purpose. See https://github.com/libyal/libfwnt/wiki/Language-Code-identifiers to get the list of available language abbreviations. Example: `{"language": "zh", "country": "CN", "variant": "Hans"}`

### ADB

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:adbPort | Number of the port where ADB is running. `5037` by default
appium:remoteAdbHost | Address of the host where ADB is running (the value of `-H` ADB command line option). Unset by default
appium:adbExecTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until single ADB command is executed. `20000` ms by default
appium:clearDeviceLogsOnStart | If set to `true` then Espresso deletes all the existing logs in the device buffer before starting a new test
appium:buildToolsVersion | The version of Android build tools to use. By default Espresso driver uses the most recent version of build tools installed on the machine, but sometimes it might be necessary to give it a hint (let say if there is a known bug in the most recent tools version). Example: `28.0.3`
appium:skipLogcatCapture | Being set to `true` disables automatic logcat output collection during the test run. `false` by default
appium:suppressKillServer | Being set to `true` prevents the driver from ever killing the ADB server explicitly. Could be useful if ADB is connected wirelessly. `false` by default
appium:ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError | Being set to `true` ignores a failure while changing hidden API access policies. Could be useful on some devices, where access to these policies has been locked by its vendor. `false` by default.
pium:hideKeyboard | Being set to `true` hides the on-screen keyboard while the session is running. Use it instead of the legacy `appium:unicodeKeyboard` one (which will be dropped in the future). This effect is achieved by assigning a custom "artificial" [input method](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/creating-input-method). Only use this feature for special/exploratory cases as it violates the way your application under test is normally interacted with by a human. Setting this capability explicitly to `false` enforces `adb shell ime reset` call on session startup, which resets the currently selected/enabled IMEs to the default ones as if the device is initially booted with the current locale. `undefined` by default.
appium:mockLocationApp | Sets the package identifier of the app, which is used as a system mock location provider since Appium 1.18.0+. This capability has no effect on emulators. If the value is set to `null` or an empty string, then Appium will skip the mocked location provider setup procedure. Defaults to Appium Setting package identifier (`io.appium.settings`).
appium:logcatFormat | The log print format, where `format` is one of: `brief` `process` `tag` `thread` `raw` `time` `threadtime` `long`. `threadtime` is the default value.
appium:logcatFilterSpecs | Series of `tag[:priority]` where `tag` is a log component tag (or * for all) and priority is: `V    Verbose`, `D    Debug`, `I    Info`, `W    Warn`, `E    Error`, `F    Fatal`, `S    Silent (supress all output)`. '*' means '*:d' and `tag` by itself means `tag:v`. If not specified on the commandline, filterspec is set from ANDROID_LOG_TAGS. If no filterspec is found, filter defaults to '*:I'.
appium:allowDelayAdb | Being set to `false` prevents emulator to use `-delay-adb` feature to detect its startup. See https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/14773 for more details.

### Emulator (Android Virtual Device)

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:avd | The name of Android emulator to run the test on. The names of currently installed emulators could be listed using `avdmanager list avd` command. If the emulator with the given name is not running then it is going to be started before a test
appium:avdLaunchTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until Android Emulator is started. `60000` ms by default
appium:avdReadyTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until Android Emulator is fully booted and is ready for usage. `60000` ms by default
appium:avdArgs | Either a string or an array of emulator [command line arguments](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline).
appium:avdEnv | Mapping of emulator [environment variables](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables).
appium:networkSpeed | Sets the desired network speed limit for the emulator. It is only applied if the emulator is not running before the test starts. See emulator [command line arguments](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline) description for more details.
appium:gpsEnabled | Sets whether to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) GPS service in the Emulator. Unset by default, which means to not change the current value
appium:isHeadless | If set to `true` then emulator starts in headless mode (e.g. no UI is shown). It is only applied if the emulator is not running before the test starts. `false` by default.

### App Signing

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:useKeystore | Whether to use a custom [keystore](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#certificates-keystores) to sign the app under test. `false` by default, which means apps are always signed with the default Appium debug certificate (unless canceled by `noSign` capability). This capability is used in combination with `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities.
appium:keystorePath | The full path to the keystore file on the server filesystem. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keystorePassword | The password to the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keyAlias | The alias of the key in the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:keyPassword | The password of the key in the keystore file provided in `keystorePath` capability. This capability is used in combination with `useKeystore`, `keystorePath`, `keystorePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` capabilities. Unset by default
appium:noSign | Set it to `true` in order to skip application signing. By default all apps are always signed with the default Appium debug signature. This capability cancels all the signing checks and makes the driver to use the application package as is. This capability does not affect `.apks` packages as these are expected to be already signed. Make sure that the server package is signed with the same signature as the application under test before disabling this capability.

### Device Locking

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:skipUnlock | Whether to skip the check for lock screen presence (`true`). By default Espresso driver tries to detect if the device's screen is locked before starting the test and to unlock that (which sometimes might be unstable). Note, that this operation takes some time, so it is highly recommended to set this capability to `false` and disable screen locking on devices under test.
appium:unlockType | Set one of the possible types of Android lock screens to unlock. Read the [Unlock tutorial](https://github.com/appium/appium-android-driver/blob/master/docs/UNLOCK.md) for more details.
appium:unlockKey | Allows to set an unlock key. Read the [Unlock tutorial](https://github.com/appium/appium-android-driver/blob/master/docs/UNLOCK.md) for more details.
appium:unlockStrategy | Either 'locksettings' (default) or 'uiautomator'. Setting it to 'uiautomator' will enforce the driver to avoid using special ADB shortcuts in order to speed up the unlock procedure.
appium:unlockSuccessTimeout | Maximum number of milliseconds to wait until the device is unlocked. `2000` ms by default

### Web Context

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:autoWebview | If set to `true` then Espresso driver will try to switch to the first available web view after the session is started. `false` by default.
appium:webviewDevtoolsPort | The local port number to use for devtools communication. By default the first free port from 10900..11000 range is selected. Consider setting the custom value if you are running parallel tests.
appium:ensureWebviewsHavePages | Whether to skip web views that have no pages from being shown in `getContexts` output. The driver uses devtools connection to retrieve the information about existing pages. `true` by default since Appium 1.19.0, `false` if lower than 1.19.0.
appium:enableWebviewDetailsCollection | Whether to retrieve extended web views information using devtools protocol. Enabling this capability helps to detect the necessary chromedriver version more precisely. `true` by default since Appium 1.22.0, `false` if lower than 1.22.0.
appium:chromedriverPort | The port number to use for Chromedriver communication. Any free port number is selected by default if unset.
appium:chromedriverPorts | Array of possible port numbers to assign for Chromedriver communication. If none of the port in this array is free then an error is thrown.
appium:chromedriverArgs | Array of chromedriver [command line arguments](http://www.assertselenium.com/java/list-of-chrome-driver-command-line-arguments/). Note, that not all command line arguments that are available for the desktop browser are also available for the mobile one.
appium:chromedriverExecutable | Full path to the chromedriver executable on the server file system.
appium:chromedriverExecutableDir | Full path to the folder where chromedriver executables are located. This folder is used then to store the downloaded chromedriver executables if automatic download is enabled. Read [Automatic Chromedriver Discovery article](docs/hybrid-mode.md#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver) for more details.
appium:chromedriverChromeMappingFile | Full path to the chromedrivers mapping file. This file is used to statically map webview/browser versions to the chromedriver versions that are capable of automating them. Read [Automatic Chromedriver Discovery article](docs/hybrid-mode.md#automatic-discovery-of-compatible-chromedriver) for more details.
appium:chromedriverUseSystemExecutable | Set it to `true` in order to enforce the usage of chromedriver, which gets downloaded by Appium automatically upon installation. This driver might not be compatible with the destination browser or a web view. `false` by default.
appium:chromedriverDisableBuildCheck | Being set to `true` disables the compatibility validation between the current chromedriver and the destination browser/web view. Use it with care.
appium:autoWebviewTimeout | Set the maximum number of milliseconds to wait until a web view is available if `autoWebview` capability is set to `true`. `2000` ms by default
appium:recreateChromeDriverSessions | If this capability is set to `true` then chromedriver session is always going to be killed and then recreated instead of just suspending it on context switching. `false` by default
appium:nativeWebScreenshot | Whether to use screenshoting endpoint provided by Espresso framework (`true`) rather than the one provided by chromedriver (`false`, the default value). Use it when you experience issues with the latter.
appium:extractChromeAndroidPackageFromContextName | If set to `true`, tell chromedriver to attach to the android package we have associated with the context name, rather than the package of the application under test. `false` by default.
appium:showChromedriverLog | If set to `true` then all the output from chromedriver binary will be forwarded to the Appium server log. `false` by default.
pageLoadStrategy | One of the available page load strategies. See https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#capabilities
appium:chromeOptions | A mapping, that allows to customize chromedriver options. See https://chromedriver.chromium.org/capabilities for the list of available entries.

### Other

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
appium:disableSuppressAccessibilityService | Being set to `true` tells the instrumentation process to not suppress accessibility services during the automated test. This might be useful if your automated test needs these services. `false` by default
appium:disableWindowAnimation | To avoid flakiness google [recommends](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/setup#set-up-environment) to disable the window animation of the Android device under test when running espresso test. `true` by default


## Settings API

Espresso driver supports Appium [Settings API](https://appium.io/docs/en/advanced-concepts/settings/).
Along with the common settings the following driver-specific settings are currently available:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
driver | 'compose' or 'espresso' | The name of the subdriver to use for elements interactions. The default value is `espresso`. Switching the value to `compose` enables interactions with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)-based application user interfaces. Read [Jetpack Compose Support](#jetpack-compose-support) for more details.


## Jetpack Compose Support

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. Espresso driver supports basic interactions with Compose-based applications since version *1.46.0*.

[Appium UiAutomator2 driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/) allows to interact with Jetpack Compose elements via the accessibility layer by providing [testTag](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/platform/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).testTag(kotlin.String)) modifier attribute or the displayed text, but this Espresso driver allows you to access Jetpack Compose elements directly.


### Interaction With Compose Elements

Espresso driver has the concept of subdrivers. This works quite similarly to the concept of contexts, while contexts are used to switch between native and web, and subdrivers are still
under the native one. Each subdriver operates its own elements cache, so it is not be possible
to mix Espresso and Compose elements.

In order to change between subdrivers use the [driver](#settings-api) setting. Setting its value to `compose` modifies driver behavior in the way it interacts with Compose elements rather that with classic Android views. It is possible to switch between `espresso` and `compose` modes at any point of time. When `compose` mode is active the the following webdriver commands behave differently (as of driver version *1.50.0*):
- findElement(s): Element finding commands only support Compose-based locators. Read [Compose Elements Location](#compose-elements-location) for more details.
- getPageSource: The returned page source is retrieved from Compose and all elements there contain [Compose-specific](#compose-element-attributes) attributes.
- click, isDisplayed, isEnabled, clear, getText, sendKeys, getElementRect, getValue, isSelected: These commands should properly support compose elements.
- getAttribute: Accepts and returns Compose-specific element attributes. See [Compose Element Attributes](#compose-element-attributes) for the full list of supported Compose element attributes.
- getElementScreenshot: Fetches a screenshot of the given Compose element. Available since driver version *2.14.0*
- `mobile: swipe`: Performs swipe gesture on the given element in the given direction.
The `swiper` argument is not supported in Compose mode. Available since driver version *2.15.0*

Calling other driver element-specific APIs not listed above would most likely throw an exception as Compose and Espresso elements are being stored in completely separated internal caches and must not be mixed.

You could also check end-to-end tests for more examples on how to setup test capabilities and
on the Compose usage in general:

## Espresso Build Config

Espresso server is in tight connection with the application under test. That is why it is important that the server uses the same versions of common dependencies and there are no conflicts. Espresso driver allows to configure several build options via `espressoBuildConfig` capability. The configuration JSON supports the following entries:

### toolsVersions

This entry allows to explicitly set the versions of different server components. The following map entries are supported:

Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
gradle | The Gradle version to use for Espresso server building. | '6.3'
androidGradlePlugin | The Gradle plugin version to use for Espresso server building. By default the version from the [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/blob/master/espresso-server/build.gradle.kts) is used | '4.1.1'
compileSdk | Android SDK version to compile the server for. By default the version from the app [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/blob/master/espresso-server/app/build.gradle.kts) is used | 28
buildTools | Target Android build tools version to compile the server with. By default the version from the app [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/blob/master/espresso-server/app/build.gradle.kts) is used | '28.0.3'
minSdk | Minimum Android SDK version to compile the server for. By default the version from the app [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/blob/master/espresso-server/app/build.gradle.kts) is used | 18
targetSdk | Target Android SDK version to compile the server for. By default the version from the app [build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/blob/master/espresso-server/app/build.gradle.kts) is used | 28

## Platform-Specific Extensions

Beside of standard W3C APIs the driver provides the below custom command extensions to execute platform specific scenarios. Use the following source code examples in order to invoke them from your client code:

```java
// Java 11+
var result = driver.executeScript("mobile: <methodName>", Map.of(
    "arg1", "value1",
    "arg2", "value2"
    // you may add more pairs if needed or skip providing the map completely
    // if all arguments are defined as optional
));
```

```js
// WebdriverIO
const result = await driver.executeScript('mobile: <methodName>', [{
    arg1: "value1",
    arg2: "value2",
}]);
```

```python
# Python
result = driver.execute_script('mobile: <methodName>', {
    'arg1': 'value1',
    'arg2': 'value2',
})
```

```ruby
# Ruby
result = @driver.execute_script 'mobile: <methodName>', {
    arg1: 'value1',
    arg2: 'value2',
}
```

```csharp
// Dotnet
object result = driver.ExecuteScript("mobile: <methodName>", new Dictionary<string, object>() {
    {"arg1", "value1"},
    {"arg2", "value2"}
});
```

### mobile: startMediaProjectionRecording

Starts a new recording of the device activity using [Media Projection](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection) API. This API is available since Android 10 (API level 29) and allows to record device screen and audio in high quality. Video and audio encoding is done by Android itself.
The recording is done by [Appium Settings helper](https://github.com/appium/io.appium.settings#internal-audio--video-recording).

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
resolution | string | no | The resolution of the resulting video, which usually equals to Full HD 1920x1080 on most phones, however you could change it to one of the following supported resolutions: "1920x1080", "1280x720", "720x480", "320x240", "176x144" | 1280x720
maxDurationSec | number | no | The maximum number of seconds allowed for the recording to run. 900 seconds by default (15 minutes) | 300
priority | string | no | Recording thread priority is set to maximum (`high`) by default. However if you face performance drops during testing with recording enabled, you could reduce the recording priority to `normal` or `low`. | low
filename | string | no | You can type recording video file name as you want, but recording currently supports only "mp4" format so your filename must end with ".mp4". An invalid file name will fail to start the recording. If not provided then the current timestamp will be used as file name. | screen.mp4

## Backdoor Extension Usage

Espresso driver allows to directly invoke a method from your application under test using `mobile: backdoor` extension. If `target` is set to `application` then methods will be invoked on the application class. If target is set to `activity` then methods will be invoked on the current application activity. If target is set to `element` then methods will be invoked on the selected view element. Only 'public' methods can be invoked ('open' modifier is necessary in Kotlin). The following primitive types are supported for method arguments: "int", "boolean", "byte", "short", "long", "float", "char". Object wrappers over primitive types with fully qualified names "java.lang.*" are also supported: "java.lang.CharSequence", "java.lang.String", "java.lang.Integer", "java.lang.Float", "java.lang.Double", "java.lang.Boolean", "java.lang.Long", "java.lang.Short", "java.lang.Character", etc.

For example, in the following arguments map

```json
{
   "target": "activity",
   "methods":
   [
     {
       "name": "someMethod",
     },
     {
       "name": "anotherMethod",
       "args": [
         {"value": "foo", "type": "java.lang.CharSequence"},
         {"value": 1, "type": "int"}
       ]
     }
   ]
}
```

the `anotherMethod` will be called on the object returned by `someMethod`, which has no arguments and which was executed on the current activity instance. Also `anotherMethod` accepts to arguments of type `java.lang.CharSequence` and `int`. The result of `anotherMethod` will be serialized and returned to the client.

## Parallel Tests

It is possible to execute tests in parallel using Espresso driver.
Appium allows to do this on per-process (multiple server processes running on different ports managing single session)
or per-request basis (single server process managing multiple sessions, more preferable, uses less resources and ensures better control over running sessions). Check [Parallel Android Tests](docs/parallel-tests.md) article for
more details.

> **Note**
> If you are _not_ going to run your tests in parallel then consider enabling the `--session-override` Appium server argument. It forces the server to close all pending sessions before a new one could be opened,
> which allows you to avoid possible issues with such sessions silently running/expiring in the background.


## Troubleshooting

* If you observe Espresso server crash on startup and various exceptions about missing class/method in the logcat output then consider updating [appium:espressoBuildConfig](#espresso-build-config) capability with module versions that match your application under test. This might require some experimentation, as different apps have different module requirements. Check, for example, [issue #812](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/issues/812)
* If you experince issues with application activities being not found or not starting then consider checking [How To Troubleshoot Activities Startup](docs/activity-startup.md) article.
* Espresso requires the debug APK and app-under-test APK (AUT) to have the same signature. It automatically signs the AUT with the `io.appium.espressoserver.test` signature. This may be problematic if you're using an outdated Android SDK tools and/or an outdated Java version.
* If there are problems starting a session, set the capability `forceEspressoRebuild` to `true` and retry. This will force rebuilding of Espresso Server. If the following session startup is successfull, set it back to `false`, so the session startup performance is back to normal.
* If you experience session startup failures due to exceptions similar to `Resources$NotFoundException` then try to adjust your ProGuard rules:
  ```
  -dontwarn com.google.android.material.**
  -keep class com.google.android.material.** { *; }

  -dontwarn androidx.**
  -keep class androidx.** { *; }
  -keep interface androidx.** { *; }

  -dontwarn android.support.v4.**
  -keep class android.support.v4.** { *; }

  -dontwarn android.support.v7.**
  -keep class android.support.v7.** { *; }
  ```
  Please read [#449](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/issues/449#issuecomment-537833139) for more details on this topic.
* When you want to build without compose dependencies
    * Espresso driver has Jetpack Compose dependencies to [support Jetpack Compose](#jetpack-compose-support). It could break the application under test's dependencies. The typical case is when the application under test does not have the Jetpack Compose dependencies. Then, you can try out [no compose dependencies branch](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver/pull/879)). In Appium 2.0, the branch is available as `appium driver install --source=local /path/to/the/appium-espress-driver` with the `no-compose-deps` branch instead of npm installation.


## Contributing

### Contents of Repo

* `espresso-server/`: Android Java code that gets built into a test apk. The test apk runs a NanoHTTP server that implements the WebDriver protocol.
* `lib/`: NodeJS code that constitutes the Appium driver, which is responsible for handling capabilities and starting up the Espresso instrumentation context. Once the Espresso server is up, this code is responsible for proxying user requests to it.

### Running

* To build the Espresso server _and_ the NodeJS code, run `npm run build`
* To just build the Espresso server, run `npm run build:server` or `cd espresso-server && ./gradlew clean assembleDebug assembleAndroidTest`. The server can also be built from Android Studio.
    * To build the espresso server for a custom target package `./gradlew -PappiumTargetPackage=io.appium.android.apis assembleAndroidTest`
* To just build NodeJS code, run `npm run build:node`

### Tests

* Espresso server unit tests are located at `io.appium.espressoserver.test` and can be run in Android Studio
* NodeJS unit tests are run with `npm run test`
* End-to-end tests are run with `npm run e2e-test` (remember to run `npm run build` before running this command so that it has up-to-date Espresso Server and NodeJS code)
